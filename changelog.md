# 4.1.0
- Websockets => interactive webapp! Transactions on homepage displayed in realtime as they are discovered.
- Redesigned UI, use custom styled boxes on homepage instead of semantic-ui Items.
- Display amount of time passed since transaction was written
- Fix bug with wrong times (UTC/Local time mismatch in webapp)
- Use 1 winston logger per 1 daemon worker. Add option to log into files.

# 4.0.0
- Big `indyscan-daemon` rewrite - it's more flexible and capable supporting range of workloads.
- New `indyscan-daemon` file configuration format
- The `indyscan-daemon` can be now run with HTTP server enabled. The exposed API enables management of workers. 
- Redesigned ElasticSearch storage model. Transaction can now have arbitrary number of format representations. 
- New transaction storage model. Each transaction has exactly 1 document in ElasticSearch, however this document
can contain many representations of the same transaction.
- Small UX fixes in webapp (clickable IndyScan header in to left, switching networks without being redirected to homepage)
- Improved documentation 
- Added project `indyscan-daemon-ui` to manage `indyscan-daemon` running workers. 

# 3.1.3
- Update to IndySDK 1.14.2

# 3.1.2
- Fix bug waiting incorrect amount of time (too long) when no new transactions are available.

## 3.1.1
- Display "Genesis Tx" instead of "Invalid date" in UI if timestamp is not present on tx.
- Fix UI error when reverse order is enabled together with TX type filter
- Adjust ES mapping to be more tolerant toward "scheduleTime" format in POOL_UPGRADE transaction
- Prettier UI
- Display transaction count given currently selected filter/search in UI
- Cap pagination to max 500 pages given default page size of 50

## 3.0.0
- Using `Elasticsearch` instead of `Mongo` for storage
- `indyscan-daemon` is reading configuration file defining what and how to scan, instead of passing configuration
  in environment variables.
- `indysccan-daemon` main scanning loop simplified 
- `indyscan-api` extracted out of `indyscan-webapp`
- Before transactions are stored in storage, various expansions on this documents take place, depending on 
  type of transaction. For example for `CLAIM_DEF` transactions, details about schema it is based on is added.
- `indyscan-webapp` - the transaction view now does not only display raw ledger data, but alo easy to read
  highlights about the transaction, depending on transactions type.
- `indyscan-webapp` - the transactions list view contains fulltext search feature
- `indyscan-webapp` - the transactions list view displays selection of important information about transaction 
  instead of `roothash` 
- `indyscan-webapp` - removed `stats` view. Can be expected to be added again in following 3.x.x versions.
- updated from `Node 8` to `Node 12`
- updated IndySDK to `1.14.1`
- decreased `inyscan-webapp` docker image size from `869` to `290` mb
- decreased `indyscan-daemon` docker image size from `3GB` to `1.3GB` (still terrible, help appreciated).
